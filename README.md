# MyMaterial

My own take on the material terminal color palette.

Drop down backgrounds - when you want to differentiate your console style terminal window  
from your normal terminal.

The original dark material theme can be found here:

The light theme is basically ![solarized](https://ethanschoonover.com/solarized/) light with the BG color changed.


The repo includes jpgs of the drop down backgrounds as well as a sample gimp project to produce similar.
If the colors look off in your terminal - try toggling the 'set bold colors as bright' settings  
if your terminal has one.
